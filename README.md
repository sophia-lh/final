# Research Context

Over the past year, our social norms and mores have changed drastically in response to the global public health crisis of COVID-19. Quotidian gestures such as the handshake seem now a kind of archaic imprudence resigned to the back-then and keeping up to date on current events seems to necessitate becoming an amateur epidemiologist. However, as the imperfect U.S. response to the pandemic has shown, opinions concerning everything from proper shutdown stringency to mask-wearing and vaccine safety can differ greatly. Indeed, last year has shown that normal epidemiological proscriptions have not adequately addressed the difficult-to-quantify social irregularities that directly influence the spread of the disease. More often than not, discussions around preventative measures and epidemiological policies do not consider the socio-political sentiments, social practices, and personal beliefs that affect the efficacy of disease control at the community level. In spike forecasting, mandating preventative guidelines, and planning vaccine distribution, understanding local sentiments and beliefs about COVID-19 is crucial.

# Project Description

In this project, the authors hope to provide a dynamic visual exploration of how local social practices, beliefs, and sentiments concerning the pandemic might influence the spread and death toll of the disease in the U.S. at the county and state levels. While misinformation and conspiracism have become central to U.S. politics, the extent to which COVID-19 denialism and misinformation have influenced the spread of the disease remains unclear. Through interactive visualizations, the viewer can easily choose particular relationships to better understand links between localized opinions and public health metrics.

# Datasets

This project uses the Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Group research, specifically the [Delphiâ€™s COVID-19 Survey data](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/). This is a current geographic location tagged social media survey in which participants report personal and local social-distancing practices, personal beliefs concerning vaccines, and mental health information. Additionally, this project uses the [New York Times COVID-19 data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/) which provides continuously updated data on coronavirus spread and death counts at the county, state, and national levels.
